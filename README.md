# Research—By Goby

## [*Headshot: One Strike, Vulnerability Scanning for Designated URLs in Batches* ](https://github.com/gobysec/Research/blob/main/Headshot_One_Strike_Vulnerability_Scanning_for_Designated_URLs_in_Batches_en_US.md)

Abstract：Headshot，it allows users to input URLs and select custom PoCs, making it easier to conduct real-world penetration testing and exploitation. With this plugin, we can now use Goby more flexibly to deal with scenarios like Struts2 vulnerabilities.

## [*RDP protocol research, we have implemented RDP screenshot and brute-force functionalities on Goby* ](https://github.com/gobysec/Research/blob/main/RDP_protocol_research_%20we_have_implemented_RDP_screenshot_and_brute-force_functionalities_on_Goby_en_US.md)

Abstract：When people talk about RDP, in addition to protocol information extraction, they mostly focus on two aspects of research: password cracking and screenshots. Ncrack/hydra/medusa are commonly used in the field of RDP cracking, while RDPy and Scryin are popular screenshot tools. However, through our actual testing, we found that there were many shortcomings, and the results were even described as terrible. We decided to implement faster, easier brute-force cracking and more comprehensive screenshot functionalities purely in Golang. In the end, we accomplished all the work in Goby.
